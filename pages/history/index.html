                I built a tool to provision and run Kubernetes clusters across Linux and Windows nodes in a super simple way.
              </p>
              <p>
                RKM was developed because I <em>tried</em> to set up RKE2 on my build servers, with the intent of running Unreal Engine build jobs in Kubernetes, but it didn't work and the uninstallation process trashed the build servers to the point that I had to reinstall Windows. I designed RKM so that it would keep all of the Kubernetes configuration, assets, storage, etc. under a unique installation directory (<code>C:\RKM</code> on Windows, <code>/opt/rkm</code> on Linux). That way I could easily just throw away the Kubernetes install by deleting a folder and let it re-provision the whole thing. By having a single executable start and manage all of the Kubernetes components, it also meant that RKM didn't have to install services system-wide other than itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also did some experimental work on getting Kubernetes to run entirely on Windows, using WSL to run the Linux bits. Unfortunately Windows services can't use WSL so this got blocked on upstream WSL bugs.
              </p>
              <p>
                As of writing, RKM is used to run UEFS on all the build servers and keep all of the installed software up-to-date, though I don't run build jobs in Kubernetes yet.

              I delivered a talk which goes in-depth about how the algorithm in our Matchmaking plugin works, so that other developers can implement it in languages and engines outside of Unreal Engine. The matchmaking algorithm we employ leverages the free lobby APIs available on EOS and Steam, so it's a cost-effective and scalable solution for independent game developers.

              <p>Package and use self-contained Unreal Engine installs on Windows, macOS, Docker and Kubernetes.</p>
              <p>
                I started work on UEFS because I wanted to explore solving the "large container image" problem that Unreal Engine containers had - where the Docker images you'd need to run were so massive that it would take hours for a container to get scheduled on a node.
              </p>
              <p>
                It turns out packaging up Unreal Engine installations and pulling them from registries was useful for more than just Docker, and the main use case then ended up being using it to sync Unreal Engine installs across all of the Windows and macOS build servers. Now instead of having to use Syncthing to keep Unreal Engine installs up-to-date on each machine, the build jobs could just choose to mount whatever Unreal Engine version they wanted to use, and it would just be fetched on demand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even more features then naturally arose out of this architecture that resulted in further benefits and increased build performance, such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Virtualising the storage that the package VHDs are served from using WinFSP, so that Unreal Engine could be mounted instantly without waiting for the whole thing to download. UEFS will then fetch the 128kb blocks from the network as they're accessed for the first time.</li>
                <li>Being able to mount the same Unreal Engine install at multiple paths on the system completely eliminated the global mutex that Unreal Engine uses to reserve the engine directory, allowing multiple Unreal Engine build jobs with the same Unreal Engine version to run on the same build server at once.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                As of February 2023, there's experimental support for UEFS packages to be mounted as volumes in Kubernetes clusters.

              <p>I was one of the organisers for Melbourne Global Game Jam 2022. Although we had hoped to host it in person, we ended up hosting it online due to the spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in Australia.</p>
              I spent most of the jam coordinating with other organisers, keeping the event running and maintaining the JamCast stream, so I did not create a GGJ game in 2022.

              <p>If you're an Unreal Engine developer with CI/CD setup, you're probably using BuildCookRun to package your game for all the platforms you're targeting. BuildCookRun is inherently slow, because it performs all of its steps sequentially on a single machine.</p>
              Learn how to drastically reduce your Unreal Engine build times by using BuildGraph instead. In this talk I'll not only cover how to write BuildGraph scripts tailored to your project, but also how to integrate BuildGraph with your CI/CD server to distribute build steps across all of the build machines you have available.

              <p>A Momentary Meeting is about exploring an ever-changing world, and the fleeting interactions you have with other people along the way. A multiplayer text adventure where the links between "rooms" changes over time and occasionally you'll meet someone else in the same space. Your meeting is short lived however, as the ever changing world pulls you apart and thrusts you back somewhere nearby.</p>

The idea was a multiplayer narrative text adventure where you incidentally meet random strangers. I actually spent most my time doing the narrative and writing for this game, rather than the programming. I actually found it quite enjoyable to just write out descriptive scenes for the game.

              Multiplayer games are huge and have great potential for long term retention of players, and that leads to ongoing revenue for a studio, but to achieve this, you need to make sure your multiplayer experience is excellent. You won't get that just throwing whatever library you can find on the asset store and hoping for the best. This talk will teach you how to implement multiplayer from the ground up, allowing you to make sure your online player experience is the best it can be.

              <p>Working out of Santa Monica, California, I was a full stack engineer at Network Next. Our focus was building a platform that could more optimally route game network traffic over the Internet based on latency, jitter and packet loss.</p>
              <p>My work at Network Next involved:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Developing backend services in Go.</li>
                <li>Developing the front-end portal in React and TypeScript, most of which is still in use as of Sep 2022.</li>
                <li>Implementing and maintaining the Unreal Engine integration for the Network Next SDK.</li>
                <li>Managing the build and deployment process to deploy the platform into Kubernetes on Google Cloud.</li>
                <li>Maintaining the development environment through Skaffold and related tools.</li>
                <li>Ordering, evaluating and managing the relay machines that network traffic was routed over, in locations all around the world.</li>
              </ul>
              I moved back to Melbourne in November 2019, and left Network Next around February 2020.

          <h2>8 Years of Game Development</h2>
          <hr />
          <p class="mt-2 mb-4 text-start">This period covers my time at university through to when we wrapped up Redpoint Games (the company). For almost all of this time I worked with Josh Harvey on game prototypes and plans on how to do game development sustainably. By the end of it we almost knew what we were doing, but we didn't have any money left and pursued our own careers in 2019.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2"><a name="2018"></a>2018</h4>
          <p class="mt-2 text-start">In 2018, I was working with Josh and Liam on games at Redpoint Games. At this time Redpoint Games was a company with all three of us as directors. When Redpoint Games reformed in 2020, it was as a sole trader under myself only.</p>
          <p class="mb-4 text-start">This was the last year we pursued game development as a team. We were unsuccessful in obtaining funding for "Minute of Mayhem" from the local funding body Film Victoria, and we no longer had the financial runway to continue through to the next potential funding round.</p>

              <p>react-injectable is a library that makes it easier to dependency inject React contexts into components, while ensuring the TypeScript hinting is correct when using the wrapped components.</p>
              This library was used heavily in the web frontend for HiveMP (see below), where developers could manage their projects.

              <p>At least in 2018, you could not automatically license installations of Unity with Personal licenses. The only way to license a machine was to go through the first-run wizard interactively.</p>
              <p>At the time I wrote this, I was doing builds in the cloud which meant that Unity itself needed to be installed on-demand. This project emulated the first-run wizard's calls to the API to obtain a license for Unity and install it on the machine.</p>
              I don't remember what I was actually running Unity for though; the last game I wrote using Unity would have been in 2015, so I suspect this might have been related to some kind of Unity SDK for HiveMP.

                Minute of Mayhem started as a prototype I developed in my last year of university in 2015. The game was initially called Sixty Seconds. The initial prototype was developed in Unity and presented at PAX Australia 2015 (through Swinburne University) and GX Australia (under Redpoint) in 2016. A trailer for the initial prototype when it was shown at PAX Australia is shown below:

              </div>
              <p>
                Following on from the prototype, we renamed it to Minute of Mayhem and started developing it from scratch in MonoGame using our own Protogame framework. I wrote a lot of features into <a href="#protogame">Protogame</a> throughout Minute of Mayhem's development in 2017 and 2018. A full feature list up until the retirement of the Protogame framework <a href="https://github.com/RedpointGames/Protogame#features">can be found on the GitHub page for Protogame</a>, but it includes things like a full deferred shading pipeline, network replication and hot reloading to name a few.

              <p>
                In 2017 we used Unreal Engine 4 for the first time, and were able to rebuild our work on Minute of Mayhem to date within two weeks. We switched away from Protogame to Unreal Engine and continued development in Unreal Engine until Minute of Mayhem was cancelled in 2018.

              After it's cancellation, we each pursued our own careers. Notably, this led to me starting work for Network Next as a contractor in the latter half of 2018 and as a full-time employee in early 2019.

              <p>We released Dimension Jump in March 2017 to positive reviews. We ran a few community streams and had it in a few bundles, and it made around $2000 AUD over it's lifetime.</p>
              <p>In 2016 it was not possible to launch games on Steam without first going through Steam Greenlight. We wanted to start using the Steamworks APIs in Minute of Mayhem, but since we weren't approved for Steam we had no access to the backend. To this end, we decided to take the <a href="#dimensionjumpclassic">original Dimension Jump</a> game that I'd released years ago, overhaul it and publish it on Steam through Steam Greenlight.</p>
              <p>By the time we published Dimension Jump, Steam Greenlight was on the way out, but it gave us a ton of experience in actually shipping a game to consumers on Steam.</p>
              <p>The original Dimension Jump was written in Game Maker 7, and we upgraded it to Game Maker Studio 1.4 in the version we released on Steam. However, Game Maker Studio 1.x ceased development and with no cost-effective upgrade path it became impractical to ship updates for the game.</p>
              In 2019 we made Dimension Jump free with a requirement to join our Discord server. The game wasn't generating revenue at this point, so we decided to use this as a way to build our Discord community. Unfortunately, we didn't take into account that players who got the game for free could leave negative reviews on the store page and we delisted the game from Steam in 2021.

              <p>GameTest is a framework for automated end-to-end testing of games. It is intended to take an almost blank slate VM, and simulate a user installing a game through Steam, verifying that the game installs and launches correctly. After that, you can specify custom test scripts to test other behaviour inside your game.</p>
              I wrote GameTest so we could automatically test Dimension Jump and catch any missing dependencies that needed to be installed with the game via the Steam install scripts.

              <p>EventHost (previously known as JamHost) is an event hosting platform. Unlike Eventbrite, it basically lets you set up a whole website for your event with multiple pages, which is great for more complex events like Melbourne Global Game Jam.</p>
              <p>The very first iteration of it was built for the 2015 game jam. At this time, it was basically a fancy website with a login system so jammers could access information. It wasn't called JamHost at this point and it didn't handle ticket registration or payments.</p>
              <p>For the 2016 jam, I added support for it to accept payments and handle registrations directly rather than being imported from Eventbrite. I don't know specifically when I added on-site registration, but I suspect it was for the 2016 jam.</p>
              <p>For the 2017 jam, Luis Van Slageren and I ported it from the old PHP framework it was running on to C# and ASP.NET Core, and made it generic enough that any in-person game jam could use it. Thus it was given the name JamHost and provided as a public service:</p>

              <p>Over the years JamHost kept getting improvements as we hosted more Melbourne Global Game Jam events, and kept getting updated as <a href="#jamcast">JamCast</a> evolved to work with JamHost.</p>
              <p>For the 2023 game jam, JamHost was renamed to EventHost because the platform is now generic enough to host many kinds of events and not just game jams:</p>

              After several rounds of playtesting, I think we decided to cancel the project as we couldn't figure out a set of rules that felt good <em>and</em> made sense.

              <p>There were a lot of mistakes made during the development of this project, and it was eventually cancelled in 2015 after failing to receive any meaningful feedback through the IndieCade judging process.</p>

              <p>From 2013 to 2015, I contributed to the open source Phabricator project. Phabricator was a collection of web applications for software development. I stopped contributing around 2015 because upstream was no longer receptive to code contributions from external developers, and in 2021 Phabricator ceased to be maintained.</p>

              <p>In addition to the myriad of bug fixes I made, I also had a hand in some of the major features of Phabricator, including the build system Harbormaster. Here are some of the notable changes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Making Phrequent, the time tracking system, more usable by adding <code>arc start</code> and <code>arc stop</code> commands to the Arcanist CLI.</li>
                <li>Implementing the core of Harbormaster, the CI build system inside Phabricator and getting it to actually function as a build system. This included running commands remotely over SSH, streaming build logs, and so on.</li>
                <li>Implementing core parts of Drydock, the resource allocation system inside Phabricator. Drydock was used to reserve machines for Harbormaster builds and check out working directories.</li>
                <li>Adding support for C# tooling like unit test execution and linting to Arcanist, so that these checks could run when developers submitted their C# code for code review.</li>
                <li>Building Phragment, which was a hierarchical versioned artifact storage system. We used this to serve game binaries and patches for <a href="#unearth">Unearth</a> builds through the game launcher we'd written.</li>
                <li>Adding early Windows support to Harbormaster and Drydock using WinRM (PowerShell remoting).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Many of my later changes, such as support for Drydock allocating KVM virtual machines, never got merged because the upstream developers stopped accepting external contributions.</p>
              <p>As part of employment at PageUp People, I also developed an internal tool called Pipeline that ran inside the PageUp Phabricator instance. This was unfortunately never open sourced or upstreamed, but it was effectively a Phabricator equivalent for <a href="https://spinnaker.io/">Spinnaker</a> and we used it to manage the extremely complex deployment process that could not be encapsulated entirely within Harbormaster build plans.</p>

              <p>In early 2012, Mojang announced the development of a space exploration game where ships could be run programs on a virtual CPU, called the DCPU-16. This open source project implemented a toolchain that targeted the CPU architecture, with the intent that tools would be able to run inside the game itself on the CPU. This constraint meant that a lot of existing projects such as LLVM were not suitable for this task, so this was a "ground up" implementation of a toolchain.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-3" src="/history/img/dcputoolchain.png" title="A screenshot of the emulator from the DCPU-16 Toolchain." alt="A screenshot of the emulator from the DCPU-16 Toolchain." />
              <p>I couldn't find many screenshots of this project, but I did find an old <a href="https://youtu.be/G6ikNc4FhrA?t=121">tutorial video on YouTube</a> which shows a little bit of what development looked like.</p>
              <p>I started the project, but many community members came onboard after only a month. I did a significant amount of the initial development on tools, with other community members improving what I'd written:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Emulator</li>
                <li>Assembler</li>
                <li>Preprocessor</li>
                <li>The initial C compiler which was written in C
                  <ul>
                    <li>This implementation was later replaced with an implementation by another community member, written in C++</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Linker</li>
                <li>Kernel ABIs and support for those ABIs in the assembler and linker</li>
                <li>Debugger</li>
                <li>Standard C library APIs</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I think the most interesting part of this project was implementing the linker; it gave me a hands on experience on how linkers really work for normal architectures, and why they are not able to produce useful error messages in a lot of cases.</p>
              <p>This project was effectively abandoned when Mojang cancelled the development of the game that it was being written for. I later worked on an open source game called <a href="#mir">Mir</a> which used the DCPU-16, but was cancelled after a month of development.</p>

              <p>When I was writing the code for <a href="#oldmanbaby">Old Man Baby</a> at the "What Would Molyduex?" game jam, I ended up building useful primitives on top of XNA. This code would end up forming the initial version of Protogame, which would later move to MonoGame as XNA was retired.</p>
              <p>It would go on to be used in no small number of projects that I developed, including Unearth (Tychaia), Minute of Mayhem and a decent chunk of the game jam games I worked on between 2012 and 2017.</p>
              <p>By the time most of my development work moved to Unreal Engine, Protogame had an impressive feature set for an open source game engine. A full feature list is available on the <a href="https://github.com/RedpointGames/Protogame#features">can be found on the GitHub page for Protogame</a>. To give you an idea, it supported 2D &amp; 3D games, deferred lighting, components and transform hierarchy, physics, networking with replication and a UI system.</p>
              <p>Towards the latter part of it's lifecycle, I started working on editors, including an experimental integration into MonoDevelop, but the editors never reached full maturity before development of Protogame ceased:</p>

              </div>
              <p>
                Protogame also spawned a number of other open source projects, including Prototest, Protoinject and Protobuild, the latter of which was adopted upstream by MonoGame before it was eventually retired in 2020.
              </p>
              <p>I stopped development on Protogame when we moved our projects to Unreal Engine.</p>

              <p>ModBridge was a project to bring forward compatibility to Minecraft mods, and to allow developers to write mods in C# against a standardized API. Mods could also be sandboxed using the C# sandboxing features, allowing mods to be automatically installed from game servers.</p>
              <p>It also solved problems with ID conflicts and meant that developers didn't need to decompile Minecraft in order to write mods.</p>

              <p>In 2011, Valve ran an ARG (alternate reality game) for the launch of Portal 2. At the end of the ARG there was a countdown to the Portal 2 launch that could be sped up by having people run certain Steam games.</p>
              <p>Coordinating what games everyone should be running on their machines was tedious, and worse, if people continued running a game that had already reached "Computations Complete", then that would lead to wastage as they could be running an "incomplete" game.</p>
              <p>I wrote a little .NET desktop client that would check a central server to see what games were still pending, and then it would automatically launch and run those games on the local Steam client based on what the user owned. You could basically just leave it running and it would automatically flick to new games as needed.</p>

                In the end the ARG only led to the game releasing less than 24 hours early, which I think the community was pretty disappointed with given how much effort had gone into solving the ARG.

                After it's launch, the cabinet was then available to play at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana_Bar">Mana Bar Melbourne</a> until it closed in 2015. Prior to the Mana Bar closing, Craig Peebles did additional work to install extra ventaliation fans to prevent overheating, and by the time that work was complete the Mana Bar had shutdown.
              </p>
              <p>
                The cabinet ran on the original Winnitron platform, being in the first dozen machines that were built around the world. After the Mana Bar closed, the original Winnitron service at winnitron.ca shutdown, and so the machine wasn't playable until the new Winnitron platform was up and running (now at <a href="http://winnitron.com/">winnitron.com</a>).
              </p>
              <p>Despite my best efforts, this is the only photo I could find of the Winnitron AU at the Mana Bar. All of the other links I could find in the Wayback Machine are dead, either because the Mana Bar itself shutdown and removed the relevant photos, or the media outlets that covered it no longer have the articles up. The Wayback Machine unfortunately doesn't capture a lot of images, so this low resolution thumbnail is all that we have.</p>

              <p>
                The cabinet was then stored in The Arcade Melbourne (1.0 on City Rd), before being moved as part of the relocation of The Arcade to Kings Way (2.0). It was briefly playable in the latter half of 2021, before being put into storage again with the permanent closure of The Arcade.

              <p>The first version of JamCast was developed in 2010 during the first Melbourne Global Game Jam (see below). With game developers all in separate rooms, I wrote a version that captured bitmap images from developer desktops and sent them to the projectors in every room - the idea being to give people visibility on what other people were making throughout the jam. Keep in mind that in January 2010, Open Broadcaster Software hadn't even been released, let alone in wide use.</p>
              <p>At each Global Game Jam, it developed more features including Slack integration and pulling tweets from Twitter off a hashtag. I also had to adapt it to the unique networking setup of each event over the years, as Melbourne Global Game Jam has been hosted at La Trobe, Swinburne, AIE, JMC Academy and online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
              <p>Although there are a few open source iterations of JamCast floating around on the Internet, it is now stored in the same private Git repository as <a href="#jamhost">JamHost</a>, since it is now tightly coupled to that online event platform. Hence this entry doesn't link to any of the open source implementations as they're all significantly out-of-date.</p>
              JamCast now uses Open Broadcaster Software under the hood and relays video streams via NGINX RTMP.

              <p>The very first Melbourne Global Game Jam. I attended this and ended up helping with the technical stuff, which is how I ended up being one of the technical organisers for the event for over a decade. This is also where I wrote the very first version of JamCast for streaming people's desktops (though it was basically just screenshots as BMP images over UDP at this point). This jam was hosted at the La Trobe University Bundoora Campus.</p>
              Apparently there is a 2010 jam listed on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2010-global-game-jam-registration-for-event-opens-this-weekend">this page of jam sites</a>, but it wasn't run by the IGDA Melbourne crew as far as I can tell.

              <p><a href="#dimensionjump">Dimension Jump</a> (the one released on Steam) was actually a remaster of an earlier freeware game I'd made and released on GameJolt. It was the first game I'd made after being stuck for a few years feeling like any idea I came up with would be derivative. It was only after talking with another member of the Game Maker Community that had made a relatively popular game and having them point out that most of their own game ideas are derivative in some form and that games evolve beyond their initial idea that I was able to get back into game development and create Dimension Jump.</p>
              <p>This original game differs from the later remaster in a few ways:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The remaster introduced the level editor and all of the Steam-related features like level sharing and leaderboards.</li>
                <li>The original had a much steeper difficulty curve; we spent a lot of time on the remaster making sure that the tutorials and first set of levels were really easy to pick up to prevent people quitting the game early.</li>
                <li>The original had themed sections; you can see in the screenshots below that one of the sections was themed as cave exploration / adventure and the other section was apocalyptic cityscape.</li>
                <li>The original had freeware music; the remaster had music made for it by a contractor.</li>
                <li>The original had an actual area that would move around in to access the levels which you can see in the screenshots below; the remaster has a more conventional menu system for level select.</li>
                <li>In the original, some levels limited the number of times you could dimension jump (seen in screenshot #4). This ran anthetical to the design of the game though, so we removed this system in the remaster.</li>
                <li>The remaster added proper support for 16:9 screen resolutions and updated the engine to Game Maker Studio 1.4 (the original was Game Maker 6).</li>
              </ul>

              <p>I wrote a packaging format for Linux called AppTools that was designed to support side-by-side library installs and mount and run applications from self-contained packages. That is, you could download the self-executing package, run it, and the AppTools wrapper would take care of mounting the package to a temporary directory and running the application.</p>
              <p>This project was eventually abandoned as I could not get the filesystem format stable, and the distribution I was writing it for (elementary OS) ended up basing their distribution on Ubuntu rather than using AppTools for packaging.</p>
              These days Snap provides the self-contained packages idea that AppTools was pursuing.

              <p>In and around 2009, I ran a game hosting website called RoketGames. I'm not sure of the exact date when this was operating from and to, because at some point between 2009 and 2011 most of the data was lost due to an exploit on the shared hosting service that it was operating on.</p>
              <p>What I've managed to construct here is from a backup that I managed to find (and at the time I didn't know I had). The backup that contained user data unfortunately only has DOS-style 8.3 filenames for everything, so it wasn't possible to get something very useable to explore beyond taking the screenshots below.</p>
              <p>RoketGames competed with other sites like GameJolt (which is still around!) and YoYoGames back when they did game hosting for Game Maker games. It hosted games, had blogs and forums, had online service APIs with an overlay (like the Steam overlay) and an instant game launcher called <a href="#yaipp">YAIPP</a>. Towards the end of it's life, I also pursued supporting commercial games, allowing developers to connect their PayPal accounts and sell games through the platform, though there was never sufficient use to sustain operational costs and the advertisements didn't cover costs either.</p>
              <p>After the shared hosting service was exploited, I was never able to restore the website source code and it died out.</p>

              <p>A digital card game that was kind of based on 500. I'm pretty sure Josh Harvey and I developed the game rules together, but it's been a while. The strategy is try and play cards towards the middle so you don't win or lose each hand. Included online play, which obviously no longer works.</p>

              <p>You can also play Zero with just a normal deck of cards and 3 other players. The rules (as explained by the ZeroPC game) are:</p>
              <h6><em>Starting</em></h6>
              <p>In the game of Zero, a player deals and the person to their right starts leading. The person who leads may pick any card from their hand to lead with, excluding either Joker.</p>
              <h6><em>Playing</em></h6>
              <p>Each player takes their turn in playing a card after the person has lead. The turns rotate anti-clockwise. If a suit is played, and the person has that suit in their hand, they must play a card of that suit or the Joker with the same color as the suit lead. If the person cannot play a card that matches the suit, then they may offsuit, throwing out a card of another suit. The card thrown out has no value and it is not counted when working out who won or lost the trick (excluding special cases). The person who plays the highest card of the suit lead starts leading next turn. The person who plays the lowest card of that suit places all of the cards played into their hand. The first person to have no cards left in their hand wins.</p>
              <h6><em>Special Cases</em></h6>
              <p>When a suit is lead, and every other player offsuits, then the person who played the lowest value card by number loses the trick. The person who lead, leads again.</p>
              <h6><em>Card Order</em></h6>
              <p>The order of card values from lowest to highest are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A, Joker.</p>

              <p>In 2008 I built a 3D RTS in Game Maker with a few friends. Game Maker didn't have the ability to batch render 3D models, which resulted in extremely poor performance for any non-trivial map, ultimately hindering any further development of the game.</p>

              <p>This was an unofficial sequel to a platforming game made by a different person. The player character is bouncy (and has no jump key). It featured a level editor and an online level pack system. It initially had a release around a December 2007 and updated throughout 2008.</p>

              <p>The very first game engine I ever wrote. It was written in C++ and used Irrlicht for 3D rendering, Lua for scripting and Newton Physics for physics simulation. It had a light-weight C++ generator that would automatically generate Lua binding code for all of the native classes. I modified Lua to support things like a first-class type system and an 'is' operator for type comparisons. Reflecting on this in 2022, it is astounding that I was <em>15 years old</em> when I was first developing this and publishing this on the Internet.</p>
              <p>To emphasize the context in which this software was developed:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>It is so old that source control history only starts in 2010. It would have initially been stored in Subversion, before moving to Mercurial. I'm not sure it was ever developed in Git; I suspect Google Code might have converted the repository when they exported it to GitHub after Google Code closed down.</li>
                <li>For the first few years of development, Unity wasn't available for independent game developers to make 3D games in. The release of Unity as a low-cost 3D game engine is what killed the development of this engine once it was made freely available to developers. If I remember correctly, the original audience for this engine were game developers who wanted to go beyond what Game Maker was capable of; once Unity released their free tier there was no longer a market for the engine.</li>
                <li>I think the IDE started development in 2010. It was later repurposed for the MOAI game engine (which I did some contracting work for in 2011) but was never released.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I've included some screenshots from the Wayback Machine below. Images link to the Wayback Machine capture of the page. The first image is from December 2007.</p>

              <p>Ah yes, "lost it all in a USB crash". Classic 2007. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081022082239/http://www.roket-productions.com:80/?page=roket3d">later capture</a> shows it's evolution during 2008.</p>
              And yes, the name that my friends and I used for our projects during this period was "Roket Productions". We were 15 - don't hold it against us.

              <p>In 2006 I started a website called Game Making Resources. It was effectively an online database of assets that people could use in their Game Maker games, and people could submit assets they made:</p>
              <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080501113353/http://www.gm-resources.com:80/resource.php?resource=sprite"><img class="img-fluid rounded mb-3" src="/history/img/gmr1.png" style="border: solid 1px var(--bs-pink);" title="A Wayback Machine capture from 2008 showing the sprite resource listing on Game Making Resources." alt="A Wayback Machine capture from 2008 showing the sprite resource listing on Game Making Resources." /></a>
              <p>Game Making Resources was built on top of PHPBB3, which is why the site styling looks so similar to the default theme of PHPBB3.</p>
              <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071105015337/http://www.gm-resources.com/resource.php?resource=sprite&id=81"><img class="img-fluid rounded mb-3" src="/history/img/gmr2.png" style="border: solid 1px var(--bs-pink);" title="A Wayback Machine capture from 2008 showing one of the sprite resources." alt="A Wayback Machine capture from 2008 showing one of the sprite resources." /></a>
              <p>At some point after the site was originally made, I implemented a bot that would crawl the asset/resource forums in the Game Maker Community and add listings for all of the topics where people were listing their assets, so that users wouldn't have to manually add them to Game Making Resources. It was a neat exercise in writing a HTTP robot and parsing HTML.</p>
              <p>In early 2009, I added a &quot;Where in the world?&quot; page where developers using Game Maker could add their location so people could see (anonymously) where Game Maker users were around the world.</p>
              <p>Somewhere in or after 2010 the site ceased operation, likely because it was on the same hosting provider as <a href="#roketgames">RoketGames</a> when that got exploited and thus the data was lost.</p>
